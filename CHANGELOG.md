## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

First release. Verified against DSH `0.2.0-rc.2` on the Web profile.

### Added

- **Selection toolbar** — selecting transcript text opens a one-button
  `批注 / Annotate` toolbar in `shell.overlay`, placed above the selection and
  clamped to the viewport; it never overlaps the composer, the submit button or
  the app chrome.
- **Note editor** — `Enter` saves, `Shift+Enter` inserts a line break, `Esc`
  cancels; an empty note marks the quote only.
- **Numbered marks** — the quote is highlighted with the CSS Custom Highlight
  API (the message DOM is never mutated) and a numbered badge is drawn next to
  it, repositioned on scroll and resize.
- **Badge popover** — clicking a badge reads that annotation in place: number,
  delivery status, origin, quote, note, plus jump to source / open in sidebar /
  delete.
- **Composer chip** — a compact `✎ ×N` control in the composer tool row
  (`conversation.input.right`), immediately before the submit action.
- **Right-sidebar panel** — a `批注 / Annotations` page registered through the
  two-stage right-sidebar tab API, with per-annotation edit, delete, jump to
  source, and clear-delivered.
- **Delivery through `agent/pre-step`** — pending annotations are appended as
  one text block to the user message entering the step, separated from the
  user's own text by a blank line and a `—— 批注（共 N 处，编号 …）——` header.
  The block is delivered exactly once and is never written into the composer.
- **Host-side persistence** — `$DSH_HOME/annotations/annotations.json`, shared
  across sessions and restarts, outside every workspace.
- **`annotation` tool** — the agent can re-read annotations (`list`) or mark
  the ones it answered (`resolve`).
- **Local HTTP API** — `POST /plugins/dsh-annotate/api`, restricted to loopback
  hosts and gated behind a custom header.
- **Localisation** — UI text follows the DSH locale (`zh` / `en`).
- **Tests** — host-half delivery tests (`node --test test/`) and a GitHub
  Actions workflow running the syntax check and the suite.

### Notes

- The plugin is a workspace bundle: `cordis.patch.yml` inserts one Host row and
  `package.json` declares the browser half through `dsh.client`. No DSH core
  file is modified.
- The host half imports only `node:*` builtins, because a workspace-installed
  bundle cannot resolve `@deepseek-ai/*` packages at runtime.
