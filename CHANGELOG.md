# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **Per-boot API token.** The host mints one random token per process and
  publishes it into the boot payload of every page it serves
  (`webserver/index-inject` → `__DSH_ANNOTATE__`); the browser half presents it
  on every request. A request is now accepted only when the `Host` is loopback
  **and** the token matches, so neither a cross-origin page nor a DNS-rebinding
  trick can reach the route. Before the first page is served the host falls back
  to the static marker header, which keeps a fresh install working while the
  browser half catches up.
- **Cross-node quote re-anchoring.** Quotes now resolve through a
  whitespace-normalized full-text index instead of a per-text-node `indexOf`, so
  a selection that spans `<strong>`, a code span or any other element boundary
  is found again after a reload, and indentation differences between the DOM and
  the copied text no longer break the match.
- **`Escape` closes the badge popover.**
- Tests for the anchoring core (`test/anchor.test.mjs`) and the authorization
  fence (`test/authorize.test.mjs`); the suite grew from 7 to 23.

### Changed

- **Re-anchoring is now one pass over the document.** The previous shape walked
  every text node once *per* annotation, which is quadratic on a long transcript;
  the index is built once and every missing quote is located against it.
- **Atomic writes survive platforms where `rename` will not replace a file.**
  The store write falls back to remove-then-rename on `EEXIST`/`EPERM`/`EACCES`
  instead of failing the save.

### Fixed

- `hostIsLocal()` is total: a request object without `headers` is refused rather
  than throwing inside the guard (found by the new authorization tests).

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/RSoulYu/dsh-annotate/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

First release. Verified against DSH `0.2.0-rc.2` on the Web profile.

### Added

- **Selection toolbar** — selecting transcript text opens a one-button
  `批注 / Annotate` toolbar in `shell.overlay`, placed above the selection and
  clamped to the viewport; it never overlaps the composer, the submit button or
  the app chrome.
- **Note editor** — `Enter` saves, `Shift+Enter` inserts a line break, `Esc`
  cancels; an empty note marks the quote only.
- **Numbered marks** — the quote is highlighted with the CSS Custom Highlight
  API (the message DOM is never mutated) and a numbered badge is drawn next to
  it, repositioned on scroll and resize.
- **Badge popover** — clicking a badge reads that annotation in place: number,
  delivery status, origin, quote, note, plus jump to source / open in sidebar /
  delete.
- **Composer chip** — a compact `✎ ×N` control in the composer tool row
  (`conversation.input.right`), immediately before the submit action.
- **Right-sidebar panel** — a `批注 / Annotations` page registered through the
  two-stage right-sidebar tab API, with per-annotation edit, delete, jump to
  source, and clear-delivered.
- **Delivery through `agent/pre-step`** — pending annotations are appended as
  one text block to the user message entering the step, separated from the
  user's own text by a blank line and a `—— 批注（共 N 处，编号 …）——` header.
  The block is delivered exactly once and is never written into the composer.
- **Host-side persistence** — `$DSH_HOME/annotations/annotations.json`, shared
  across sessions and restarts, outside every workspace.
- **`annotation` tool** — the agent can re-read annotations (`list`) or mark
  the ones it answered (`resolve`).
- **Local HTTP API** — `POST /plugins/dsh-annotate/api`, restricted to loopback
  hosts and gated behind a custom header.
- **Localisation** — UI text follows the DSH locale (`zh` / `en`).
- **Tests** — host-half delivery tests (`node --test test/`) and a GitHub
  Actions workflow running the syntax check and the suite.

### Notes

- The plugin is a workspace bundle: `cordis.patch.yml` inserts one Host row and
  `package.json` declares the browser half through `dsh.client`. No DSH core
  file is modified.
- The host half imports only `node:*` builtins, because a workspace-installed
  bundle cannot resolve `@deepseek-ai/*` packages at runtime.
